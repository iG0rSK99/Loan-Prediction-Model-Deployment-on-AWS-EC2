🏦 Loan Prediction Model Deployment on AWS EC2

This project demonstrates a **Loan Approval Prediction Machine Learning Model**, deployed on an **AWS EC2 instance** using **Flask**. The model predicts whether a loan should be approved based on user inputs like income, gender, marital status, credit history, etc. A clean and responsive web interface built with HTML and CSS allows users to interact with the model.
